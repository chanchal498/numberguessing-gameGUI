# numberguessing-gameGUI
This project is an interactive desktop application developed during my internship at INTERN ALPHA It transitions traditional "guess the number" logic into a modern, (GUI) environment. The game challenges users to find a hidden number between 1 and 100 within seven attempts, blending logical algorithms with event-driven programming.
